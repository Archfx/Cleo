## Cleo : Cryptographic Leakage Evaluation of Hardware

Cleo is a Test Vector Leakage Assessment (TVLA) project that evalautes hardware implementations of cryptographic instruction set extentions for physical side-channel leakage. Current framework  supports evalauting ongoing RISC-V cryptography extension standardization work. This is a complete power side-channel evaluation framework parallel to the existing test-based [functional validation suite](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/) and [formal verification suite](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/). 


The RISC-V instruction set architecture is known for its open-source and customizable design. One of the notable features of RISC-V is its modular and extensible nature, allowing developers to add custom instructions and extensions tailored to specific applications. There are several ongoing works on developping cryptographic instruction set extensions of RISC-V architecture. 

- [riscv-crypto](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/): RISC-V cryptography extensions standardisation work.
- [xcrypto](https://github.com/scarv/xcrypto): a cryptographic ISE for RISC-V


### TVLA

Test vector leakage assesmsnt tries to quanitfy potention power side channel leakage of a hardware imeplementation at early stage design life cycle. The device's power consumption fluctuates as it executes computations, responding to changing logic states and data processing. These current variations generate distinct patterns that enable the analysis of the ongoing operations. By observing these power consumption fluctuations and correlating them with specific computations, an adversary can deduce sensitive data, such as cryptographic keys or plaintext, without needing direct access to the internal memory or processes of the target device.




### Project Structure

Here is the project structure. all the extensions under testing (```eut```) are initilized as submodules. Currenlty,  [riscv-crypto](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/), [xcrypto](https://github.com/scarv/xcrypto) and [scarv-soc](https://github.com/scarv/scarv-soc) are elvaluated.

### Running CLEO 🏃‍♀️

Followings are the steps to run the framework. Docker is a pre-requisit for Cleo since the complete enviroment for building everything is provided in [archfx/cleo](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/archfx/cleo/general) container.

1. Clone the project repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Archfx/Cleo  cleo
```
2. Use the following commands to initiate submodules
```shell
cd cleo
git submodule update --init
```
3. Pull the docker container and mount the project (You should be inside the project directory)
```shell
docker pull archfx/cleo
docker run -t -p 6080:6080 -v "${PWD}/:/Cleo" -w /Cleo --name cleo archfx/cleo
```
4. Access the docker container
```shell
docker exec -it cleo /bin/bash
```
5. Finally run Cleo
```shell
cd evaluator && make
```

### Pre-Silicon Side Channel Evaluation of RISCV-CRYPTO ISE

Original implementations of the hardware functional units of RISCV-CRYPTO have a strong correlation with the input values. As an example following is the power side channel signature of the [ssha512](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/blob/e2dd7d98b7f34d477e38cb5fd7a3af4379525189/rtl/crypto-fu/riscv_crypto_fu_ssha512.v) functional unit and the visual relationship between the input values. Evaluation results of other components are available in ```evaluator``` folder.

### Pre-Silicon Side Channel Evaluation of XCRYPTO ISE

Original implementations of the hardware functional units of XCRYPTO have a strong correlation with the input values.
As an example following is the power side channel signature of the [xc_sha256](https://github.com/scarv/xcrypto/blob/9ff3426a9d498bf41880caca4bc3769eec0e5093/rtl/xc_sha256/xc_sha256.v) functional unit and the visual relationship between the input values.  Evaluation results of other components are available in ```evaluator``` folder.

### System Evalaution with the SoCs ([WiP](https://github.com/Archfx/Cleo/tree/dev))

This part of the project is still in development and on the [dev](https://github.com/Archfx/Cleo/tree/dev) branch. Steps for running SoC version are as follows,

```shell
git fetch --all
git checkout dev
cd eut/scarv-soc
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd <fu> && make tvla-fu
```
